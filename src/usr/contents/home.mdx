## Introduction to the Research Database
This website is dedicated to providing open-access resources for the archaeological study of modern-day Afghanistan, offering a comprehensive platform for scholars, researchers, and enthusiasts interested in the region’s rich cultural history. For the time being, a particular focus is put on clay and stucco sculptures (and, occasionally, mural paintings) unearthed from two Buddhist sites in the area of Kabul, Tepe Narenj and Qol-e Tut, excavated during the 2000s also thanks to the support of the Italian Archaeological Mission in Afghanistan. Other forms of scientific collaborations allowed us to partially include Mes Aynak. Thus, the database brings to light relatively new additions to our knowledge that make a significant contribution to broadening our understanding of Afghanistan’s archaeological narrative. By combining detailed documentation with an intuitive interface, this resource fosters collaboration and further exploration of the ancient art and architecture of this historically significant area.

#### Unveiling Sculptures from Tepe Narenj
Tepe Narenj, nestled in the hills overlooking Kabul, has long been recognized as an important Buddhist site. The sculptures discovered here, originally belonging to complex decorative programmes, reveal a blend of local craftsmanship and broader artistic trends and emblematic imagery from Central and South Asia. This website features high-resolution imagery, scholarly analyses, and detailed context for each artifact, enabling users to explore the spiritual and artistic significance of these works in the Buddhist tradition of ancient Afghanistan.

#### Qol-e-Tut: disclosing new insights
Situated a short distance from Tepe Narenj, like the latter Qol-e Tut appears to belong to tight network of Buddhist settlements, probably in close connection with each other. Despite the poor preservation of the sculptures, the in situ remains show some original features ‒ never before seen in Afghanistan ‒ indicating, among other things, close artistic, religious and cultural connections with Buddhist sites in a wider area, including regions of western Central Asia and Xinjiang.

#### Mes Aynak: A Crossroads of Art and Commerce
Mes Aynak, a vast archaeological site in Logar Province, is not only renowned for its copper deposits but also for its extraordinary Buddhist remains and the exceptional preservation of organic materials and aggregates. The ensemble of the artefacts recovered here and the unique features of the landscape offer a glimpse into the region’s role as a cultural and economic crossroads on the ancient road network and global trading systems. This platform catalogues these treasures with precision, presenting a digital repository that highlights Mes Aynak’s contribution to the study of the stylistic, technical, material and symbolic features of the Afghan Buddhist art and its legacy to later pan-Asian traditions.

#### Other collections
The website wishes to broaden its scope to capture the interconnectedness of the region’s art history. Other cognate artistic productions, even from areas other than modern-day Afghanistan, which nonetheless attest to phenomena of cultural continuity, reciprocity and symbiosis across time and space, could be included in the future.

This comprehensive database aims not only to preserve the legacy of these archaeological sites but also to provide an invaluable tool for advancing research and fostering a deeper appreciation for Afghanistan’s historical and cultural contributions to the world.
