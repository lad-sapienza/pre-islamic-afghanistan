## Introduction to the Research Database
This website is dedicated to providing open-access resources for the archaeological study of modern Afghanistan, offering a comprehensive platform for scholars, researchers, and enthusiasts interested in the region’s rich cultural history. With a particular focus on sculptures unearthed from key sites such as Tepe Narenj, Mes Aynak, and Butkara, the database brings to light centuries-old artifacts that have played a pivotal role in shaping the understanding of Afghanistan’s archaeological narrative. By combining detailed documentation with an intuitive interface, this resource fosters collaboration and further exploration of the ancient art and architecture of this historically significant area.

#### Unveiling Sculptures from Tepe Narenj
Tepe Narenj, nestled in the hills overlooking Kabul, has long been recognized as an important Buddhist monastic site. The sculptures discovered here, ranging from intricate stucco figures to elaborate depictions of the Buddha, reveal a blend of local craftsmanship and broader artistic influences from Central and South Asia. This website features high-resolution imagery, scholarly analyses, and detailed context for each artifact, enabling users to explore the spiritual and artistic significance of these works in the Buddhist tradition of ancient Afghanistan.

#### Mes Aynak: A Crossroads of Art and Commerce
Mes Aynak, a vast archaeological site in Logar Province, is not only renowned for its copper deposits but also for its extraordinary Buddhist remains. The sculptures recovered here—often found in conjunction with monastic ruins and trade artifacts—offer a glimpse into the region’s role as a cultural and economic crossroads on the ancient Silk Road. This platform catalogs these treasures with precision, presenting a digital repository that highlights Mes Aynak’s contribution to the study of Gandharan and post-Gandharan art styles.

#### The Butkara Collection: Echoes of the Ancient Gandharan Civilization
Located in modern-day Pakistan but deeply tied to Afghanistan’s shared historical and cultural heritage, Butkara is a treasure trove of Gandharan art. The sculptures from this site demonstrate the synthesis of Greco-Roman, Indian, and local styles that define the Gandharan aesthetic. By including Butkara in its database, the website broadens its scope to capture the interconnectedness of the region’s art history. Visitors can delve into detailed entries, examining the iconography and stylistic nuances that make these sculptures invaluable to the study of ancient South Asia.

This comprehensive database not only preserves the legacy of these archaeological sites but also provides an invaluable tool for advancing research and fostering a deeper appreciation for Afghanistan’s historical and cultural contributions to the world.
